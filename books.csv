7,Dreams of Shadows,Patrick Sean Lee,"Christmastime, 2017.

With a sudden, nuclear-like flash of light, the population of the planet is decimated. Every living human, save one Amelia McDougal--a 15 year old girl living in Marysville, California--has perished. Or so the young girl thinks until she meets Munster Gardella, a devil-may-care boy her age.
  Their days are filled with scavenging, wandering through the small neighborhood they once called home, and wondering what happened that caused the calamity. They get their first clue when a strange, ominous, vapor-like being emerges from the shadows near a now-deceased friend's home, and then pursues them.
  Taking refuge inside a church rectory, Amelia and Munster discover two other survivors—a black brother and sister hiding inside a closet. And then two grisly-looking adults bent on doing them harm. Munster rescues the three young would-be victims, and fearing more of the same in the city, they strike out in search of safety elsewhere.
  The four kids stumble upon a huge house set back in an orchard, miles south of the city limits, and there Munster sees a flash of light from a window. Friend or foe? Munster decides to investigate, and that is when the nature and meaning of what happened to the planet begins to unfold in the terrifying, yet oddly promising days and events that follow.

157,The Quantum Prophecy,Ryan Matthew Harker,"(Complete Story)

IN THE NEAR FUTURE...

On a planet much like our own a diabolical madman uses a power once only dreamed of to open a portal, a wormhole ripped across space/time, through which to lead his hellish army in a dark quest for vengeance and conquest. This madman is the sorcerer Harmony and he is now the undisputed supreme ruler of all that is left of the great, green Earth. He sits on a throne of bones and dreams of the day he will return to claim what is rightfully his.

Traveling the occupied territories once known as the United States of America a young man struggles to stay once step ahead of the soldiers who doggedly pursue him. Lost to a bestial madness by night, by day he is just plain lost. His name is Candlelite; he never asked for this burden yet he carries it with honor and integrity beyond his years.

Max Kimbal is a genetic engineer and quantum physicist unparalleled in his fields. Hired by a billionaire's son to help him realize his dead father's dream of journeying to alternate universes via quantum tunneling, Max is also the only survivor of Harmony's arrival on Earth. Shouldering the blame for Harmony's conquest Max has appointed himself the wormhole's watchdog. Though now lost to alcoholism the scientist remains ever vigilant in his observations.

The immortal mercenary Jeshux DuTerriux Jules has crossed the very fabric of existence in his pursuit of the sorcerer Harmony. Presently the soldier pursues a prey the likes of which he has never seen before. Some primordial instinct whispers that herein lies the key to stopping Harmony's insanity. Jeshux only hopes he can catch the beast in time.

A puzzled bear meanders under the forest's canopy. It's puzzlement stems from a partially remembered scent, an odor from the past that sends it seeking answers to questions it did not know it possessed. Steadfast the confused animal follows it's nose to one who may hold the answers.

But years later, he is drawn to a city he's never been to, a town full of blood sucking leeches, better known as vampires, the sworn enemy of werewolves and vice versa. As much as he wants to leave fate keeps pushing him back. And the reason is simple yet confusing, a girl who he has seen only once, but has already embedded herself in his mind, and vice versa. Both of them know the truth of what they are feeling, but cannot except it. As the two slowly slowly discover the truths of the other, passions flare, treacherous plots are put into motion, and an forbidden yet unbreakable bond is formed.

In a world where demons feast freely on human souls, an organization fights on the frontline to protect not only the human world, but their own as well. The rules are simple: no human can see demons, therefore no human will be purposefully made aware of their existence. But if a human does become aware of their existence, then measures must be taken to ensure their silence- the cheaper and more permanment solution, the better.

So what happens when one of the slayers has befriended a human by the name of Nathan Hitagashi, a senior-year, part-time mechanic? Especially when they see the demonic mark on his back, a Mark that all demons share.

Choosing allies in a world that he only recently learned about, Nathan Hitagashi must learn to survive this new realm by hiding just how different he really is from the others as he tries to learn more about his missing parents and the circumstances surrounding his father's disappearance years ago.

Survival soon becomes the least of his problems.

446,Bin To Earth,Matt Woods,"A story about a flirtatious witch, a zombie who inadvertently swears, a hobgoblin who likes Postman Pat vans and may other intriguing characters.

Imagine standing by the salad bar in your local supermarket and spotting a headless man feasting at the delights on offer. Ponder over how you'd re-act if during your maths class a ghost, witch and banshee turn up to take part in your lesson. Contemplate how you'd feel if your next candidate for a job interview was a six foot skeleton with very few of the skills required to fill the position. These are the issues the locals of Malster have to contend with when a group of 'fantasy' characters unexpectedly arrive on Earth.

Bin To Earth follows the exploits of a small group of individuals who are lured to our planet by objects they hope will change their lives forever. But how will they adjust to life in a world they know nothing about? Not only that but, where will they live? What will they eat? And who on Earth will provide them with a roof over their head whilst they try to figure out a way of returning 'home'?

If you fancy a light, humorous, entertaining and at times, silly read, then hopefully Bin To Earth will satisfy your reading requirements.

In the beginning, Dragons and Mortals alike lived together in peace. As time went on, Mortals began to advance in technology and grow their population to the point where they needed more land and better technology in order to sustain themselves. They turned on their former allies, the mighty Dragons, and took over some of their lands. Their technology was advancing to a point that it began polluting the environment with chemicals harmful to the Dragons. The Dragon Broods strongest members gathered together and met with the Mortals to discuss the matter. The Mortals decided they had no need for the Dragons anymore and would take the whole of Vestom for themselves. This led to the Great War between Mortals and Dragons. Only one would remain victorious.
After the Great War, the Dragon Broods fought amongst themselves over land and the battle split them apart. Each brood claiming an area of land for themselves. Will their in-fighting cause the destruction of yet another brood? Will they be too weak for any future threats? Will one of their own grow to threaten them all... It remains to be seen who will perish and who will survive to see the end of the millennia.

778,A Vampyre's Daughter,Jeff Schanz,"**SAMPLE ONLY**
  A troubled Army vet wishes he were dead...
A lonely vampyre wishes she were human...
And a ruthless drug lord wishes he were immortal...
  After a failed suicidal mission to destroy an opium kingpin’s yacht, Army vet, Brandt Dekker, is shipwrecked on a desolate island.  He is initially happy to be alive -- until his haunting memories return.
A stunning, yet awkward, girl named Lia has been caring for him, along with her mysterious and frightening father. They seem merely eccentric at first, until an astonishing truth surfaces: Lia has fangs. Real serpent-like fangs. She confesses to be a vampyre and yet promises no harm to Brandt.
  Panicking, Brandt tries to escape the island, but the only possibility is an ancient derelict boat that has no motor or sails. There is nowhere on the small island to hide. He must come to grips with his new neighbors, and find a way to become allies if they are all to survive. Because, there are real monsters hunting Brandt. Monsters with guns and explosives rather than fangs or claws. Assassins who will find this island and kill anyone in their path to get to Brandt.
  With help from Lia to repair the boat, Brandt pledges to set sail and lure the assassins away. But the repair takes days. And as each day passes, Brandt finds himself more and more enchanted by the sweet and gentle woman who claims to be a benevolent vampyre. He doesn't believe he deserves love and happiness, but could they possibly lie in this enchanting girl's embrace?
  Her past has imprisoned her on the island, and his has imprisoned his soul, and both of their worst fears come back to threaten their newfound hope together. Brandt had been willing to sacrifice his life for a chance at redemption against his enemies, until he came to the island.  Now there is more at stake than he is willing to sacrifice. In a battle to save their lives, Brandt will also fight for his soul against a terrifying enemy that is more powerful than he could have ever imagined.

826,Dear Diary--A Journal From Hell,Patrick Sean Lee,"Hell.

It brings shudders to everyone, if only in our secret thoughts. What do YOU imagine it to be? A nightmarish kingdom such as the one Hieronymus Bosch envisioned, perhaps? A perilous account by Dante, guided by Virgil?

What would happen if you were unjustly sentenced to go there...without an explanation why? For all Eternity?

I received a package in the mail recently, wrapped in a battered and soot-blackened wrapping. Intrigued, yet somewhat wary of the contents that might lie within, I poured myself a cup of strong coffee, retired to my comfortable chair in the living room of my modest home in front of a cheerful fire, and then opened it tentatively.

There was no note; no explanation concerning the ""gift""--who might have sent it, or by what post it was initiated. A thin book, in worse condition than the package wrapping. Scarred by fire, bent at the edges, altogether distressing.

No title. No author name.

I carefully flipped the cover, curious but unafraid by then. I had opened...a diary. An account written by the hand of a man named Terence, as I was to discover. The first words captivated me. ""He's watching me. He beats me when I cross his path."" The rough script nearly illegible at first.

And so, I read on. This was NOT Dante, but it was fascinating. See for yourself. Take a seat before your warm, crackling fire, and then walk with this soul through Hell.",Fantasy,4556 Words,Ages 14 and up,473,29,03-12-2011,,https://www.bookrix.com/_ebook-patrick-sean-lee-dear-diary-a-journal-from-hell/,

Everything seemed to turn black for a few seconds until all I could feel was immense pain. Where did the numbness go? Why does it feel like my body is trying to rip itself apart?

I knew mother would be freaking out and I would get a yearlong lecture from Dad, but that’s what you get for living in the forest…
You see we live in the Forest castle of Englindon ‘a satanic minority’ in 1550- apparently the woods are cursed by pixies and sprites: living here makes you ‘Satan’s city of demons’. All the other cities in Englindon hate and conspire to slay us. But none dare to brave the forest. That is the one good thing about living, here I guess.
  The King Rolderik the 1st is terribly ill and his advisors rule the city now- they think curfews are the way of life and we are not allowed out after sundown.   Which is unfortunate when the market is in the central sanctum and you live within the outer walls.

2389,MystikQuest,Jeff Schanz,"“Why is Switzerland in my kitchen?”
  A tabletop, role-playing game called MystikQuest is a fun diversion from the disappointing lives of Wes Walker and his socially awkward, junior high friends, Marc and AJ.  It doesn’t matter to Wes that his friends think his game is a lame rip-off of “Lord of the Rings.”  Playing fantasy fiction is harmless fun until one fateful day when Wes discovers a dying creature in his treehouse, clutching an old arrowhead relic Wes dug up from his back yard.  The creature looks remarkably like a goblin.  Fiction soon becomes reality.
  What Wes thought was an old arrowhead turns out to be an ancient magic artifact that defends itself by spinning elaborate, seemingly realistic illusions.  One moment, they’re all in AJ’s basement, entertaining other reluctant teens banished from the adult party upstairs, the next moment, a sunny, Swiss mountainscape appears where AJ’s kitchen should be.  It’s only an illusion, but it looks, sounds, smells, and feels real.
  The level of inexplicability rises when Wes’s mysterious, long-lost Uncle Dru suddenly shows up claiming to be a real-life wizard assigned to protect the stone from a rogue member of his order.  On cue, a black-clad wizard with red eyes bursts in, initiating a wand duel that trap the six bewildered teens in the crossfire.   Stray wand blasts trigger the stone’s defense mechanism and the kids are magically transported into the fictional world of Wes’s MystikQuest game.
  Chosen for them by the stone, the kids are thrust into ironic game avatars:  Meek and scrawny Marc is a charismatic, muscular warrior; quiet, autistic Schroeder is a transcendent druid; brainy, logical Wes is a mystical wizard; tall, stylish high-schooler Tyler is a diminutive hobbit; introverted emo Katie is a scantily-clad, voluptuous elf warrioress; and foul-mouthed, obnoxious AJ is the equally foul-mouthed and obnoxious half-ogre.  Adjusting to their new superhuman bodies and abilities, they must navigate the game to somehow conclude its story for the stone to release them.  But how can a bunch of nerdy, awkward teens who rarely exercise or go outside, much less know how to fight maniacal orcs and fire-spewing dragons, be expected to defeat an entire evil kingdom as daunting as (and ripped off from) Tolkein’s Mordor?  And how can they stop the red-eyed wizard from sabotaging the game and hunting them like prey?
  With help from two of the game characters, a kindly, garrulous old wizard and an Aragorn-like heir in exile, the kids will battle giant spiders, drunken brutes, moronic orcs, plagiarized plots, and their own insecurities to somehow beat the game before they’re stuck in the stone’s illusion forever.

2405,A Vampyre's Sunrise,Jeff Schanz,"The exciting sequel to… “A VAMPYRE’S DAUGHTER.”
  Will a vampyre and a human be allowed to live together in peace?
  Living like a normal (albeit secluded) couple on the outskirts of Los Angeles, Brandt and Lia are managing to not only be safe but happy. Brandt works as a consultant for the Army’s Special Division, and Lia is a successful author with sassy fellow-author friends. No one knows she is a vampyre. Instead, everyone believes Lia has a unique and fatal skin condition, prompting precautions everywhere she goes for her health. The UV shielding windows of her house, and high, solid walls of her Ventura ranch, adequately keep Lia safe. It all seems to be working to plan – until the cartel returns.
  Brandt is called to consult on a mass murder case at an abandoned factory. The telltale signs point to Mikhail’s defunct cartel in what looks like an ominous message to Brandt. Is one of Mikhail’s family or associates out for revenge against Brandt and Lia? Defensive measures are taken, and the new 24/7 security team Brandt hires become Lia’s extended family. Despite the new threat, Lia is pleased to be the matriarch of a bustling domain, if she can just keep her secrets hidden. But forces are conspiring to push Mikhail’s superhuman elixir into the open, and it’s just a matter of time before someone finds out the ingredient that makes it so powerful: vampyre blood.
  A dangerous new cartel boss emerges with a scheme to make a poisonous elixir facsimile that will addict the mass public and destroy them from the inside out. He is a mystery to Brandt’s Army division. No one has ever seen his face since he is always cloaked and masked, with amazing strength, speed, healing ability, and an intense desire to crush his enemies. Plus a murderous vendetta against Brandt and Lia.
  A year ago, on Lia’s island, the couple had nothing to lose but their lives. Now there are friends and acquaintances caught in the crossfire of a diabolical plot to kill Brandt and drain Lia’s body of her extraordinary vampyre blood.
  Brandt and Lia must once again battle the evil that hunts them. But this time, they are not alone.
