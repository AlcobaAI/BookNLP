7,Dreams of Shadows,Patrick Sean Lee,"Christmastime, 2017.

With a sudden, nuclear-like flash of light, the population of the planet is decimated. Every living human, save one Amelia McDougal--a 15 year old girl living in Marysville, California--has perished. Or so the young girl thinks until she meets Munster Gardella, a devil-may-care boy her age.
  Their days are filled with scavenging, wandering through the small neighborhood they once called home, and wondering what happened that caused the calamity. They get their first clue when a strange, ominous, vapor-like being emerges from the shadows near a now-deceased friend's home, and then pursues them.
  Taking refuge inside a church rectory, Amelia and Munster discover two other survivors—a black brother and sister hiding inside a closet. And then two grisly-looking adults bent on doing them harm. Munster rescues the three young would-be victims, and fearing more of the same in the city, they strike out in search of safety elsewhere.
  The four kids stumble upon a huge house set back in an orchard, miles south of the city limits, and there Munster sees a flash of light from a window. Friend or foe? Munster decides to investigate, and that is when the nature and meaning of what happened to the planet begins to unfold in the terrifying, yet oddly promising days and events that follow.

157,The Quantum Prophecy,Ryan Matthew Harker,"(Complete Story)

IN THE NEAR FUTURE...

On a planet much like our own a diabolical madman uses a power once only dreamed of to open a portal, a wormhole ripped across space/time, through which to lead his hellish army in a dark quest for vengeance and conquest. This madman is the sorcerer Harmony and he is now the undisputed supreme ruler of all that is left of the great, green Earth. He sits on a throne of bones and dreams of the day he will return to claim what is rightfully his.

Traveling the occupied territories once known as the United States of America a young man struggles to stay once step ahead of the soldiers who doggedly pursue him. Lost to a bestial madness by night, by day he is just plain lost. His name is Candlelite; he never asked for this burden yet he carries it with honor and integrity beyond his years.

Max Kimbal is a genetic engineer and quantum physicist unparalleled in his fields. Hired by a billionaire's son to help him realize his dead father's dream of journeying to alternate universes via quantum tunneling, Max is also the only survivor of Harmony's arrival on Earth. Shouldering the blame for Harmony's conquest Max has appointed himself the wormhole's watchdog. Though now lost to alcoholism the scientist remains ever vigilant in his observations.

The immortal mercenary Jeshux DuTerriux Jules has crossed the very fabric of existence in his pursuit of the sorcerer Harmony. Presently the soldier pursues a prey the likes of which he has never seen before. Some primordial instinct whispers that herein lies the key to stopping Harmony's insanity. Jeshux only hopes he can catch the beast in time.

A puzzled bear meanders under the forest's canopy. It's puzzlement stems from a partially remembered scent, an odor from the past that sends it seeking answers to questions it did not know it possessed. Steadfast the confused animal follows it's nose to one who may hold the answers.

But years later, he is drawn to a city he's never been to, a town full of blood sucking leeches, better known as vampires, the sworn enemy of werewolves and vice versa. As much as he wants to leave fate keeps pushing him back. And the reason is simple yet confusing, a girl who he has seen only once, but has already embedded herself in his mind, and vice versa. Both of them know the truth of what they are feeling, but cannot except it. As the two slowly slowly discover the truths of the other, passions flare, treacherous plots are put into motion, and an forbidden yet unbreakable bond is formed.

In a world where demons feast freely on human souls, an organization fights on the frontline to protect not only the human world, but their own as well. The rules are simple: no human can see demons, therefore no human will be purposefully made aware of their existence. But if a human does become aware of their existence, then measures must be taken to ensure their silence- the cheaper and more permanment solution, the better.

So what happens when one of the slayers has befriended a human by the name of Nathan Hitagashi, a senior-year, part-time mechanic? Especially when they see the demonic mark on his back, a Mark that all demons share.

Choosing allies in a world that he only recently learned about, Nathan Hitagashi must learn to survive this new realm by hiding just how different he really is from the others as he tries to learn more about his missing parents and the circumstances surrounding his father's disappearance years ago.

Survival soon becomes the least of his problems.

446,Bin To Earth,Matt Woods,"A story about a flirtatious witch, a zombie who inadvertently swears, a hobgoblin who likes Postman Pat vans and may other intriguing characters.

Imagine standing by the salad bar in your local supermarket and spotting a headless man feasting at the delights on offer. Ponder over how you'd re-act if during your maths class a ghost, witch and banshee turn up to take part in your lesson. Contemplate how you'd feel if your next candidate for a job interview was a six foot skeleton with very few of the skills required to fill the position. These are the issues the locals of Malster have to contend with when a group of 'fantasy' characters unexpectedly arrive on Earth.

Bin To Earth follows the exploits of a small group of individuals who are lured to our planet by objects they hope will change their lives forever. But how will they adjust to life in a world they know nothing about? Not only that but, where will they live? What will they eat? And who on Earth will provide them with a roof over their head whilst they try to figure out a way of returning 'home'?

If you fancy a light, humorous, entertaining and at times, silly read, then hopefully Bin To Earth will satisfy your reading requirements.
